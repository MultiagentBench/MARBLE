  content: "This is in the game of Minecraft. Build a building according to a blueprint.\
    \ The blueprint contains necessary information about the material, facing direction\
    \ and position of each block.\n*** The minecraft knowledge card ***\nHere are\
    \ some knowledge about minecraft:\n1. The minecraft world x,z is the horizontal\
    \ coordinate, y is the vertical coordinate. y=-61 is the ground level.\n2. You\
    \ can use the tool or empty hand to dig the block, and place the block to the\
    \ world.\n3. You can find the item in the chest. Item in the chest can not directly\
